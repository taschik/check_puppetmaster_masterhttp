Nagios/Shinken plugin to check the node status on a puppetmaster.
The script was originally created by Bernd Adamowicz.

It has been modifiedto run under Bash 4.1.5 and to accept hosts 
from /etc/default/check_puppetmaster_masterhttp which are ignored
for the status check

The /etc/default/check_puppetmaster_masterhttp can contain an entry
for ignored hosts in the form of

IGNORE_HOSTS="domain.tld domain2.tld"
